          <p>
            Managing patient populations in the short, medium, and long term is
            essential to providing excellent care. But the road to meeting
            value-based quality metrics isn't always a straight or short one.
            Our proprietary iCMS application empowers you to do more with your
            EMR, eliminating guesswork and confusion, while improving patient
            health and connectivity.
